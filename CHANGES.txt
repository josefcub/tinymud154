Changes in TinyMUD Version (1.5.4.1) by AJC

10-Jul-19

     Fixed compile error in game.c with "union wait stat;". 

28-Apr-04	

    Fixed many of the source files in order to facilitate
		compilation of the 1990 TinyMUD source code under
		Linux 2.2.19/glibc-2.1.3, and fixed many unrelated
		compiler warnings too.

		Wrote a workaround for a crasher bug if you @boot your-
		self.  Also, added another redundant safety check, you
		can no longer @boot a player that is not connected.

		Changed page output and response, and added page-pose
    capabilities.  Prepend your message with ":" to page-pose.

		Changed whisper's output and responses, adding posing
		capabilities.  Prepend message with ":" to whispose.

		Added a VERSION #define, and the command '@version'
		to the system, to help identify the system.

		Removed -DISLANDIA, -DTINYHELL, and -DTINKER from the
		Makefile and sources.

    Restructured the tarball found into discrete game/ and 
    src/ subdirectories, and changed src/config.h to match.

		game/data/help.txt changed to reflect version, and the
		author's tastes.

		Flags, costs, and such changed liberally in src/config.h 
    as well, to more closely match this idiot's FuzzBall
		experience.
		
		CMU, daytime, and nighttime restart scripts removed, 
		replaced by restart script which functions similarly to 
		the TinyMUCK/FuzzBall restart script.  

		game/do_gripes edited for new directory structure.
		
		New script, clean_db, created to handle garbage collection.

		README file updated for the new millenium.

		Last but not least, I'm not calling this Islandia, main-
		ly because while this originated as Islandia's source, 
		I am not the owner/maintainer of Islandia MUD, and the 
		name is not appropriate for this branch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Islandia Version (1.5.4f) by Fuzzy (Michael Mauldin)

01-Sep-90	Added timestamp/usecnt feature. -DTIMESTAMPS

		Every object created carries a timestamp, and every
		object has a use count and last used stamp.  These
		are shown by the 'examine' command.  For this purpose,\
		'use' is defined as follows:
	
		PLAYERS		when they type a command
		ROOMS		when they are entered
		EXITS		when traversed or looked at (using 'look')
		THINGS		when taken or looked at (using 'look')

06-Oct-90	Added speedups.  Especially made the trailing newline
		part of the packet for each line, this reduces the
		number of calls to malloc by half, and improves the
		network performance.

		Added 'u<time>' option to extract.  Example:
		
		extract all u2mon	Removes things not used in 2 months

		Added code to Gods WHO list to show Tinker/Bot flags.

08-Oct-90	Added @date, @top, @tune

		New commands (use sparingly, they chew CPU time and
		lock up the whole system while they operate):
		
		--------------------------------

		@date [ time [ = number ] ]

		Summarize recent usage (numbers of objects with last
		use since <time> ago).  Time is an integer followed by
		a letter for [s]econds, [mi]nutes, [h]ours, [d]ays,
		[w]eeks, [m]onths, or [y]ears.  Default time is 1
		month.  Default unit is seconds.

		Examples:

		@date 1y   Find how much stuff has been used this year
		@date 2d   Find how much stuff has been used in the past 2 days

		--------------------------------

		@top [ number [ = type ] ]

		Show the top <number> objects of type <type> ranked in
		order of use count.  Types are [p]layer, [e]xit,
		[r]oom, and [t]hing.  If no type is given, all objects
		are sorted together.

		Examples:

		@top 30 = rooms		Find 30 most used rooms
		@top 20 = p		Find 20 most active players
		@top 10			Find 10 most used objects alltogether

		--------------------------------

		@tune [ var = value ]

		Sets the various timing parameters in the interface.c
		program.  Variables are

		slice		Length of time slice
		burst		Maximum commands before slowdown
		timeout		Select timeout when no commands in queue
		poll		Select timeout when commands are in queue
		extra		Allow over quota commands when otherwise idle
		
		Examples:

		@tune
		Current server settings:
		  slice 1000 ms, burst 20 cmds
		  timeout 100 ms, poll 10 ms, extra yes

		@tune slice = 500

Changes in Islandia Version (1.5.4) by Fuzzy (Michael Mauldin)

25-Jun-90	Allow people to drop exits they are carrying that
		have location -1 (this fixes a problem with exits
		that get recycled while they are carried).

9-Jun-90	Added failure message for whispers to objects
		Made DUMPCORE on error the default (writes DB,
		  then calls abort() with SIGILL enabled).  Set
		  -DNODUMPCORE to inhibit core dumps.
		Unified Islandia & TinyHELL sources, with switch
		  in config.h
		Added Virus (Robert Hood's) port concentrator.
		Added connect.txt, for messages before the connect.
		
		There are now 5 text files associated with TinyMUD:
			connect.txt	before logging in
			motd.txt	after logging in
			tinker.txt	after logging in for tinkers
			news.txt	News command
			help.txt	Help command

17-Jun-90	Added Virus's concentrator code.
		Fixed extract to allow player names instead of numbers,
		  and added special commands: reachable, players,
		  norecycle a<num> b<num>
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Islandia/Hell Version (1.5.3C) by Random (Russ Smith)

5-Jun-90	Made ABODE govern dropto
		Allow players to DARKen objects that they own and are
		  carrying, but not let them drop DARK objects in an
		  area they couldn't link to.
		Added UNWANTED flag, which allows people to @chown
		  objects to themselves, subject to locking;
		Made @chown understand 'me'
		Made @recycle set its object to be UNWANTED
		Made page and whisper check the WHO list and
		  respond appropriately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Islandia Version (1.5.3B) by Fuzzy (Michael Mauldin)

31-May-90	Added casts to signal arguments to get rid of
		annoying warnings from gcc.

28-May-90	Added @count & @recycle...@count is redundant with
		@stat for players, but it can also be run by
		non-tinkers, and @count of a room summarizes
		contents: a new feature.  Note that @count is
		less work than @find, because only the db array
		is used, no strings are referenced.

		Also fixed bug in extract:

			extract all -<player>

		now extracts player and his contents...before,
		a bug/feature/omission caused only the player
		to be extracted.

		Syntax:

		@count <player>
		@count <room>

		@recycle <thing> = <recipient>
		@recycle <thing>		defaults to Recycler.

		Recycling an object destroys its strings, and chowns
		the object to a player called Recycler.  The idea is
		that periodically you can "extract all -<recycler-num>"
		to remove the recycled objects.

		Added code to extract to check for isolated rooms
		(no entrances, or no entrances, exits, or contents).

		Fixed bug/feature in extract that caused it to complain
		aboute unlinked exits being carried by players.  It no
		longer complains about them.

28-May-90	Added NOFAKES switch to forbid use of names that
		are really first words from important system messages
		(A, An, The, You, Your, Going, Huh?)

25-May-90:	Added code to @bobble to chown all the players
		objects to another user.

20-May-90:	Added ROBOT flag...enables OUTPUTPREFIX/SUFFIX,
		prevents ROBOT players from getting objects,
		using exits, or entering rooms with ROBOT set.

		Changed Wizards to Tinkers, Temples to Junkpiles,
		and 'sacrifice' to 'donate'.  Added special
		MOTD for Tinkers (file ../lib/tinker.txt).

		Also changed @toad to @bobble.

		Fixed problem with @link on links that are
		set to *home*.

		Fixed security hole that allowed a Wizard to
		@force God...thus preventing

		    @force Wizard = @set *Apprentice = WIZARD

		Changed game.c so that on errors both a database
		dump and a regular core dump are written.

17-May-90:	Fixed bug where @name guest = foo bar caused
		a crash because guest has no password (file set.c)

		Added MOTD function, file ../lib/motd.txt
		(files help.c, interface.c)

		Added caching of hostnames so that Tinkers can do a
		WHO without bogging down the server.

11-May-90	Added Random's "page <name> = <msg>" command, to allow
		sending messages simply...people otherwise used
		
		   @name me = <msg> / @page <name> / @name me = <desc>

		anyway, so why not make it easy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Firefoot version (1.5.3A) (Scott Goehring):

Added code to detach netmud from the terminal on startup (-DDETACH).

Netmud now writes to a log file instead of stderr when detached.
SIGUSR2 will close and reopen the log file.

SIGTERM and SIGINT now cause netmud to shutdown cleanly instead of
panicking (good for when your system is /etc/shutdown'd).

Added parallel compile support to the makefile (if you're on a
Sequent, compile with 'make P=\&').

Log file entries are now preceded by the time of day.

The status dumper (SIGUSR1) has been removed.

Added Random's preregistration support (disabled create, @pcreate).

Added OJ's examine hack.

Added Random's @owned command.

Panics now dump the contents of the sigcontext struct in hex to the
logfile for debugging purposes.


Changes in version 1.5.3-FF.1 (Scott Goehring):

WHO can take an argument; only names with the same prefix as the
argument are displayed.

LINK_OK code modified; ABODE flag added.

Player may select format and order of WHO listing.

!-bug fixed properly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in version 1.5.3:

Gripes now get sent immediately to GOD when GOD_PRIV is defined.  They
can be blocked by setting HAVEN.

Limited @newpassword command to GOD when GOD_PRIV is defined.  Otherwise
any WIZARD could subvert GOD.

Added special case to do_name for changing the case of a player name.

Added interface changes, GOD_PRIV hacks, and HAVEN bit. [These Changes
from Random at TinyHELL]

Got rid of LOOKUP_COST; replaced it with special FIND_COST and PAGE_COST.  
find defaults to being very expensive.

Added hash table for player name lookups.  This change should
eliminate a lot of thrashing.

Fixed ok_name test so that ! can appear after the beginning of a name.


Changes in version 1.5.2:

Added Stephen White's pronoun substitution code under #ifdef GENDER.

Changed test for setting a created object's home to current room to
require control of the room instead of linkability.

Objects sent to rooms with @teleport go through dropto's.

Boolean operators can no longer appear in names.

Added rudimentary string compression under #ifdef COMPRESS.

Fixed missing OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX on WHO command in interface.

Fixed various small bugs not caught in 1.5.1.


Changes in version 1.5.1:

@newpassword command added.  Password checking added.  1p charge for
changing your own name eliminated to prevent confusion.

Database structure modified to allow for boolean expressions as keys.
USE_VFORK, DB_INITIAL_SIZE, and DB_DOUBLING #defines added to allow
for greater system-dependent configuration.

Whisper command added.

Name formatting centralized.  Names now include flags.

ok_player_name() modified to reject names longer than
PLAYER_NAME_LIMIT.

Boolean lock code added.


Changes in version 1.4.2:

Small bug fixes; okname() modified to reject names containing
ARG_DELIMITER, democratized teleport added under #ifndef
RESTRICTED_TELEPORT.


Changes in version 1.4.1:

Radically rewritten interface.c with fair command processing, command limits.
